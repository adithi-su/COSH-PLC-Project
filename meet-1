Open source H/W development
PLC (Programmable logic controller) 
STM 32 - ARM 32 bit controller 
ARM single core -> multicore -> (multi stage boot processing?) -> integrate with real time OS -> design and dev of device drivers
Industrial applications - GPIU, UART drivers, developing small library routines (test with STM devices)
To-Do- 
Revise C 
bitwise, unions, fxn prototypes 
learn how to read datasheets 

Edit- 
STM32F407 pin structure, datasheet - go through
